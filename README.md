# GridOrganizerFrontend

## Thoughts and ideas
This Angular frontend application was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.13 and built to complement the backend project [GridOrganizerBackend](https://github.com/SWKei/GridOrganizerBackend). I have made it responsive so that users can access the application on small devices. 
Additionally, I have implemented even pagination for the list to handle receiving a long list of data.

### Technical features:
- Angular 14
- Angular template form
- Typescript
- SCSS
- Responsive design
- Bootstrap
- Ng Bootstrap Pagenation
- CSS Grid, Flexbox
